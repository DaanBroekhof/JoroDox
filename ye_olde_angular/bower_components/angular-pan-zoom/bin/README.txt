*** TL;DR: The bin folder has been deprecated, use the files in the release folder instead ***

Details: The bin folder, used in versions previous to 1.0.5, was a poor choice, as pointed out in the following issue:

For the time being, that is for all 1.* versions, we will release identical files in the bin folder and the
release folder. You should, however, regard the bin folder as deprecated. Once we bump to 2.* we will
remove it as part of cleaning up.
